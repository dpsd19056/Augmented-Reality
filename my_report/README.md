# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
Fist, i copied and pasted the cylinder and sphere lines of code from a website, then i copied and pasted the snow entity from another website and changed the attributes
so that the snow was bigger and more visible, as the default snow particles were very small and scarce. In the end copied and pasted the speech command, but couldnt make it work, although i believe im close to the solution of it.
